1. create all blocks, with their orientations:
  OBLOCK : [ [1,1,0,0,
              1,1,0,0,
              0,0,0,0],
              [1,1,0,0,
              1,1,0,0,
              0,0,0,0],
              ....
              ]

2. Creaate a mapping list: blocksmap: [OBLOCK, JBLOCK, ...]

create a blocksarray : [List of Block Structs]

Block Struct:
- byte: type
- byte: color
- byte: block_orientation
- word: block_base_addr       <- the left-most address of this block, which is within the GAME_LAYOUT thing
