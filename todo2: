projection map method for collision checks:

projection map is the copy of the current map of the game state.
whenever we want to change the drawing, we make changes to the projection map.
Then, we check if the # of colors in the projection map is equal to the # of colors within the original map
if so, then we have a perfect thing that we can move and allow it.
